### Recreate an image using only CSS

1. All Html was given
2. Only CSS should be used to recreate this image:
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiy-greenville-frontend-2016-feb/assets/master/assignments/html-intro-layout/octodex.png
3. jumped straight in using inline-flex to make them line up nicely, borrowed the idea and some of the basic set-up code from a tutorial the teacher had us do at http://learnlayout.com/
4. added a pseudo-element for the number sign for the footer
5. had some issues with the spacing of the footer, fiddled with it for awhile until I decided on using relative and absolute positioning, which seems to have fixed most of it (still a little wonky, especially the text positioning for the caption, but good enough for today)
6. my browser is having real issues understanding the concept of sans-serif fonts, which I'll need to look into later
7. using % sizing for the images initially has made it scale decently well, though not perfectly (the footer still has issues when it gets really small)
